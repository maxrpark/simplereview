In case you want to store the review value on the local storage you can do so by adding ls="true".

This will save the value of the rating on the localStorage with the name of your id.

The value of the review will be there next time you visit the page or refresh it.

resultValue will make the review static, the value can not be updated if you click on it.

## Dynamic data

To use Simple Review with dynamic data, you need to initiate the package after you get the data. For example in plain javascript you need to do this:

3. After you get the data, you can map over it and create the slides
4. Initiate the package

You can adapt this to your favorite framework.
